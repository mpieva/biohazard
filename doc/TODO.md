- see which error formula works better: 1/4 or 1/3
- ordering of bases in samtools model: increasing or decrasing quality

- store likelihoods somehow; needs a sensible file format

  transitions and transversions, especially on Denise)
- for Kay: test on Altay, Ust-Ishim, Denise (Kay method: cull and count
  to get heterozygosity)
